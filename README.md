## Coding Style

- Use tabs(4 spaces)

- Variables start with a small letter an each new word after it starts with an uppercase letter. (variableOneExample)

- Class names follow the same format except they also start with an uppercase letter. (RedCarClass)

- Declare variables at the top of a function and refrain for declaring in the middle of the function.

- Separate code with a new line in each section (examples below)

- Always try to list needed comments explaining the function above where the function starts

- Always try to list needed comments explaining the variables at the top of the function above the variables

- Refrain from very long one line code, rather split it between a few lines

### Example

~~~ c++
  //This is an example of how our code should look
  public ExampleClass::ExampleFunction()
  {
      //explain variables if needed
      int varOne = 1;
      int varTwo = 0;
      //NEW SECTION thus an open line
      for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      {
          cout << "Manor we shall merit by chief wound no or would. Oh towards 
                  between subject passage sending mention or it. Sight happy do

      }
      //NEW SECTION thus an open line
      if(true)
      {
          if(true)
          {
              if(false)
              {

              }
              else
              {

              }

          }
      }
      else
      {

      }  
  }
